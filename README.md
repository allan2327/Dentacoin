## Why?

Dentacoin is an industrial Blockchain concept invented by Dentacoin Foundation in the Netherlands. 

Our mission is to contribute to improving dental health and equal access to high quality dental care to all people, through giving the power in the hands of the people. 

Through this game-changing concept, patients can use their experience and feedback to impact on improving the dental treatment quality while simultaneously reducing the costs. 

The Dentacoin ERC20 token is configured to be used globally by all individuals. 

Dentacoin Fundation, the DCN inventor, bought 100% of Dentaprime International PLCs’ shares thus the disposition over the company will be in the hands of Dentacoin Foundation and will be connected to the blockchain. Each DCN represents and participates in the company’s shares and dividends. The DCN community will vote for important decisions of the company through an integrated voting system. 

Further projects are planned:
The health data base: In addition to the currency (DCN), the Ethereum blockchain will securely handle all private patient data. Further data will be updatable and accessible to patients. The Insurance: Following treatment, Dentaprime will offer each patient a DCN paid insurance policy for lifelong free dental procedures to prevent all the health consequences related to old-age poverty.

Dentacoin will develop as both, a stable growing international currency and an attractive alternate derivate system for investors.
