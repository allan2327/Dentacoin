# Dentacoin - Health Care Industry should be in the hands of the people

Join us in creating a decentralised global currency based on the Ethereum blockchain.

[![Getting started with Status](http://dentacoin.com/web/img/Dentacoin_what.png)](https://d11oz1xo3vrzp6.cloudfront.net/publish/2017/3/21/1edbd2db1098476f840ecdad55f29769.mp4 "Getting started with Dentacoin")


## Why?

Dentacoin is an industrial Blockchain concept invented by Dentacoin Foundation in the Netherlands. 

Our mission is to contribute to improving dental health and equal access to high quality dental care to all people, through giving the power in the hands of the people. 

Through this game-changing concept, patients can use their experience and feedback to impact on improving the dental treatment quality while simultaneously reducing the costs. 

The Dentacoin ERC20 token is configured to be used globally by all individuals. 

Dentacoin Fundation, the DCN inventor, bought 100% of Dentaprime International PLCs’ shares thus the disposition over the company will be in the hands of Dentacoin Foundation and will be connected to the blockchain. Each DCN represents and participates in the company’s shares and dividends. The DCN community will vote for important decisions of the company through an integrated voting system. 

Further projects are planned:
The health data base: In addition to the currency (DCN), the Ethereum blockchain will securely handle all private patient data. Further data will be updatable and accessible to patients. The Insurance: Following treatment, Dentaprime will offer each patient a DCN paid insurance policy for lifelong free dental procedures to prevent all the health consequences related to old-age poverty.

Dentacoin will develop as both, a stable growing international currency and an attractive alternate derivate system for investors.

## How to Contribute?

Go straight to the [wiki](https://wiki.status.im) or [join our Slack](http://slack.status.im) or choose what interests you:

- **Developer**  
Developers are the heart of software and to keep Status beating we need all the help we can get! If you're looking to code in ClojureScript or Golang then Status is the project for you! We use React Native and there is even some Java/Objective-C too!  
Want to learn more about it? Start by reading our [Developer Introduction](http://wiki.status.im/contributing/development/introduction/) which guides you through the technology stack and and start browsing [beginner issues](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner). Then you can read how to [Build Status](http://wiki.status.im/contributing/development/building-status/), which talks about managing project dependencies, coding guidelines and testing procedures.  

- **Community Management**  
Metcalfe's law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system - without community Status is meaningless. We're looking to create a positive, fun environment to explore new ideas, experiment and grow the Status community. Building a community takes alot of work but the people you'll meet and long lasting relationships you form will be well worth it, check out our [Community Development Guide](https://wiki.status.im/community/development/)

- **Specification / Documentation**  
John Dewey once said "Education is not preparation for life; education is life *itself* ". Developers & Designers need guidance and it all starts from documentation and specifications. Our software is only as good as its documentation, head over to our [wiki](https://wiki.status.im) and see how you can improve what we have.

- **Blog Writing**  
Content is King, keeping our blog up to date and informing the community of news helps keep everyone on the same page. [Jump on our Slack](http://slack.status.im) and discuss with Carl how you can contribute.

- **Marketing**  
In this day and age attention is limited, we need all the help we can get to find people who are interested in Status, whether that is paid user aquisition, public relations or hype building, check out our [Community Outreach and Marketing Guide](http://wiki.status.im/contributing/outreach/) to see how you can spread the word.

- **Testers**  
It's bug hunting season! Status is currently in Alpha and there are sure to be a bunch of education, [grab your fresh copy of Status](http://TODO) and shake your phone to submit bug reports, or start browsing our [Github Issues](http://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues). Every bug you find brings Status closer to stable, usable software for everyone to enjoy!

- **Security**  
Status is a visual interface to make permanent changes on the Blockchain, it handles crypto-tokens that have real value and allows 3rd party code execution. Security is paramount to its success. You are given permission to break Status as hard as you can, as long as you share your findings with the community!

- **Design & User Experience**  
It's all about that sex appeal, we want cryptocurrencies to be easy and fun to use, ugly software doesn't help adoption. [Check out our designs](https://TODO) and show us how to make them better!

- **Evangelism**  
Help us spread the word! Tell a friend *right now*, infact tell **everyone** - yell from a mountain if you have to, every person counts!

## Let me try!

Currently the fastest way to get your hands on Dentacoin is using Metamask on PC/Mac or Status/uPort on mobile (testnet only).
