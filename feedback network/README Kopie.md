# Dentacoin - Health Care Industry should be in the hands of the people

Join us in creating a decentralised global currency based on the Ethereum blockchain.

[![Getting started with Dentacoin](http://dentacoin.com/web/img/Dentacoin_what.png)](https://d11oz1xo3vrzp6.cloudfront.net/publish/2017/3/21/1edbd2db1098476f840ecdad55f29769.mp4 "Getting started with Dentacoin")

## The starting point

Nowadays, the more health problems people have, the more they must pay.
Patients pay not only for their own ignorance on dental care concerns (dental hygiene routine and nutrition) but also for the dentists’ inability to treat them properly and to keep their teeth healthy in the long term.

## The solution

Dentacoin terminates this fundamentally insufficient and unfair approach by developing a revolutionary blockchain-based insurance concept where responsibility for one’s health is shared and interests are aligned between dentists and patients.

Patients are guaranteed to receive lifelong free dental services by paying extremely low monthly fees to their dentists in Dentacoin (DCN). On the other hand, dentists will be motivated to always keep their patients in a perfect dental health condition by providing them with proper care and advice. Subsequently, if the patient’s health condition is not maintained to standard by the dentist, the costs that arise thereafter will have to be covered by the dentist him/herself.

This need for an improvement in the quality of dental care will be supported by the Dentacoin’s cloud-based Feedback System where patients can give their honest and valuable feedback to each dentist.

In addition to that, an educational website that focuses on expanding patients’ knowledge about dental care issues and an aftercare app that assists patients in steps to be followed post-treatment will be provided. Thus, patients will become more aware of how to properly take care of their dental health which will inevitably contribute to dentists’ efforts to keep their patients’ teeth in a flawless condition.

Moreover, the ETH blockchain will securely handle all patients’ health records. Data will be highly protected, updatable and accessible only by patients. When permission is granted, dentists will be able to access and assess their patients’ medical history records.

## The distribution

The DCN distribution model is aimed at value creation for the dental industry worldwide. Each activity which generates value for the dental industry will be rewarded with Dentacoins (learn more). DCNs could be used to pay for unaffordable dental treatments. Due to the DCN being limited in amount and thus – inflation-protected, the value is expected to increase in time, giving the involved parties further benefits.

To further increase its relevance as a store of value, each Dentacoin is legally bound to one share of the Dentacoin foundation and all its commodities. This truly revolutionary concept not only backs Dentacoins directly with real world assets but allows all coin holders to vote for important decisions regarding the foundation. In the long term, Dentacoin holders participate in the growing value of the global healthcare industry.
